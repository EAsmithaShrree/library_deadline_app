# library_deadline_app
This app aims to make keeping track of books borrowed from various libraries easy. The app helps remind the user of the due date for the books . If the books have passed their due date, it calculates the fine based on the fine scheme of that particular library. This flutter project uses Dart programming language and Google Firebase for backend.
